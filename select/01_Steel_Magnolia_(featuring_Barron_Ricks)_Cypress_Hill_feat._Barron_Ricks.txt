{That takes a fourteen shot clip
You expectin' an army?
No, just the division}

Yeah, once again
(That's right)
We about to attack this
(Harlem Inc, Murder Inc)
Yeah
(Nicky Bond)
Jimmy Cagney type shit, Nicky Santoro
([Incomprehensible])
All my little short niggaz
Joe Pesci and all that shit like this yo

Fillin' out the cards to your eulogy
Murder that ass, send my regards to your family, fuck it
That's what niggaz get for fuckin' with this maniac depressive nigga
With aggresion, Smith and Wesson, in his possession
Harlem got me like that, too many grimy, slimy niggaz on the take
For short cake, we won't hesistate
I miss inhabitants who politic in residence for presidents
Across 110th, to 55th

My covenant is protected, I'm doministic
Survival principle's my ethics, eastern philosophy's my method
Good Samaritans need paremedics, so what's your premise
I hope you fuckin' with Glocks and fo' fifths
Wrath's Napolean, so teach your [Incomprehensible], slash wrists
Shatter chins, and bust clips
Check it, here is somethin' you can't understand

I got the steel magnum, braggin', leavin' my toe tagged
As I get raggamuffin', no bluffin', the body bagged
Breaks all your bad habits, bad blood fanatics
Clean up the magic, chrome startin' up static
Greed means that you die quick, click the vision
Greed lies ambition, five slugs for the mission
Seven 'cause you go to the Heaven or Hell and dwell
To meet your maker, but you met the shotgun shell

Buckshots sting like bees, I smoke trees
On the hilltops, clubshops and chilling oas
Take in the breeze, Mr. Freeze squeeze the trigger
Killa G's got you weak in the knees, yo take it easy!
Steel Magnolia, magnificent guns bust when Uzi weighs a ton
And yo' Glock spits, consecutive rounds shot from clips
Spells murder, sound synonymous to burner
Leave niggaz ass up, gaspin' for air, front seats of truck

So who the fuck want me to press on they luck, bastard they son
When gats start to hum and whole crowds begin to run
Anhilation, destroyin' all expectations
Have relatives embrace your Harlem hopital, so we all patient
We 5 foot 6, concealed steel, pop more grip
With fixed sights that drifted to right, triggers light
So relinquish son, I'm to the finish, and you acknowledge
Couldn't pop a clutch or light a skyrocket, nigga stop it!

Steel Magnolia, bury ya
Six niggaz carry ya to your final rest area
What you worried though? You ain't above that with a slug
And your chest beats, blowin' out your back, take it easy
To your eulogy, open heart surgery
Emergency, 911, come in a hurry
From the Hills to the Polo Realms, stackin' the bills
I put you under my lo-lo, hit my switch, then kill

A bitch nigga steppin' on my toes, fuck foes and hoes
Get stuck in the ass like Pete Rose
I suppose you wanna get wild and throw blows, you chose
To get you nose your broke, in a thick cloud of smoke
You're like a fat joint, I'm takin' a toke, I'm like coke
But you ain't smilin', feelin' erratic, a fuckin' addict
To the dope shit, you better hope the shit stop
Smooth, holdin' the Glock, rockin' the hot shit

Steel Magnolia, Steel Magnolia
Steel Magnolia, Steel Magnolia
