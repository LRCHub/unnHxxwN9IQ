[00:15.55] Sugar Magnolia blossoms blooming
[00:18.32] Head's all empty and I don't care
[00:21.52] Saw my baby down by the river
[00:24.94] Knew she'd have to come up soon for air
[00:44.44] 
[00:30.98] Sweet blossom come on under the willow
[00:33.94] We can have high times if you'll abide
[00:36.98] We can discover the wonders of nature
[00:40.15] Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside
[01:01.65] 
[00:46.34] She's got everything delightful
[00:49.49] She's got everything I need
[00:52.59] Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
[00:55.75] Pays my ticket when I speed
[01:09.25] 
[01:17.94] She come skimming through rays of violet
[01:20.61] She can wade in a drop of dew
[01:23.93] She don't come and I don't follow
[01:26.96] Waits backstage while I sing to you
[01:44.46] 
[01:33.45] She can dance a Cajun rhythm
[01:36.15] Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive
[01:39.30] She's a summer love in the spring, fall and winter
[01:42.56] She can make happy any man alive
[01:58.56] 
[01:48.90] Sugar Magnolia
[01:51.89] Ringin' that blue bell
[01:54.86] Caught up in sunlight
[01:57.98] Go on out singing
[01:59.37] I'll walk you in the sunshine
[02:01.32] Come on honey, come along with me
[02:17.82] 
[02:06.42] She's got everything delightful
[02:09.68] She's got everything I need
[02:12.66] A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight
[02:15.84] Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed
[02:32.34] 
[02:22.56] Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
[02:25.21] When the moon is halfway down
[02:28.67] Sometimes when the night is dying
[02:31.68] I take me out and I wander 'round
[02:37.17] I wander 'round
[02:44.67] 
[02:43.95] Sunshine daydream
[02:47.03] Walkin' in the tall trees
[02:50.14] Goin' where the wind goes
[02:53.80] Blooming like a red rose
[02:56.98] Breathing more freely
[03:00.04] Light out singing
[03:01.49] I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
[03:05.43] Sunshine daydream
[03:08.58] Walk you in the sunshine
