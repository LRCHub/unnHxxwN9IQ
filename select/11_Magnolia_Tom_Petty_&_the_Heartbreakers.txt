From a table across the room
She was signaling me with her eyes
I walked over to be introduced
I said, "Hello", she just smiled
And said, "I know a place
Not too far from here
We could get away for a while"
Yeah, that's when she kissed me
And told me her name
I never did tell her mine

Magnolia
I remember the smell
Of the wind through the sweet Magnolia
And I know that she's out there
Somewhere in the world
She's forgotten me but I remember her
Magnolia

Well her lips were as warm
As that wet southern night
Her eyes were as black as the sky
And I wondered aloud
Just what I had done right
As I lay there, with her by my side
Then she took hold of my hand
As she looked up at me
And said, "Now I must tell you goodbye"
And there in the moonlight
As I watched her leave
I felt a chill down inside

Oh, Magnolia
I remember the smell
Of the wind through the sweet Magnolia
And I know that she's out there
Somewhere in the world
She's forgotten me but I remember her
Magnolia

I remember the smell
Of the wind through the sweet Magnolia
