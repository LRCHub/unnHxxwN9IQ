[00:42.23] Hold on magnolia to that great highway moon
[00:58.73] No one has to be that strong
[01:08.14] But if you're stubborn like me
[01:11.68] I know what you're trying to be
[01:27.18] 
[01:21.06] Hold on magnolia
[01:30.09] I hear that station bell ring
[01:38.04] And you might be holding the last light I see
[01:48.69] Before the dark finally gets a hold of me
[02:09.19] 
[02:19.77] Hold on magnolia
[02:27.39] I know what a true friend you've been
[02:37.19] In my life I have had my doubts
[02:46.70] But tonight I think I've worked it out with all of them
[03:14.20] 
[02:55.34] Hold on magnolia to the thunder and the rain
[03:18.08] To the lightning that has just signed my name To the bottom line
[03:50.08] 
[03:50.26] Hold on magnolia to that great highway moon
[04:17.87] No one has to be that strong
[04:24.31] But if you're stubborn like me
[04:28.54] I know what you're trying to be
[04:44.04] 
[04:48.53] Hold on magnolia
[05:03.47] I hear that lonesome whistle whine
[05:16.31] Hold on magnolia
[05:23.65] I think it's almost time
[05:31.88] Hold on magnolia
[05:45.44] I think it's almost time
[06:04.50] It's almost time
