[00:00.79] Magnolia
[00:04.89] She could have anyone in the world
[00:10.20] Floats around town in a golden gown
[00:14.89] Born in a castle on a cloud
[00:28.39] 
[00:19.96] Magnolia
[00:23.54] Prettiest girl that I know
[00:27.59] Stars in her eyes
[00:29.59] Handpicked from the skies
[00:32.23] Beautiful soul
[00:39.23] 
[00:38.71] How can I compete with her?
[00:42.86] Perfection is the only word
[00:47.39] I think of when I think of Magnolia
[00:57.47] She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
[01:08.99] I wish I could be Magnolia
[01:21.99] 
[01:30.94] Magnolia
[01:34.30] She can move oceans and rivers with ease
[01:39.41] A word from her lips
[01:41.79] Her sirens kiss
[01:43.81] Will send you straight into abyss
[02:00.31] 
[01:49.52] Magnolia
[01:51.80] I wish she'd give her secrets away
[01:56.83] Enchants everyone
[01:58.95] And I think it'd be fun
[02:01.20] To be like her someday
[02:12.20] 
[02:07.82] But I cannot compete with her
[02:12.02] Perfection is the only word
[02:16.75] I think of when I think of Magnolia
[02:26.52] She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
[02:38.46] I wish I could be Magnolia
[02:51.46]
