Whippoorwill's singing
Soft summer breeze
Makes me think of my baby
I left down in New Orleans
I left down in New Orleans

Magnolia, you sweet thing
You're driving me mad
Got to get back to you, babe
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had

You whisper "Good morning"
So gently in my ear
I'm coming home to you, babe
And I'll soon be there
And I'll soon be there

Magnolia, you sweet thing
You're driving me mad
Got to get back to you, babe
You're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had

Magnolia, you sweet thing
You're driving me mad
I got to get back to you, babe
'Cause you're the best I ever had
You're the best I ever had

Magnolia, Magnolia, Magnolia
Magnolia, Magnolia, Magnolia
Magnolia, Magnolia, Magnolia
Magnolia, Magnolia, Magnolia
